# FiveM-Rappel

Adds the ability to use a rope to rappel upwards and downwards. The resource uses custom keybinds that can be configured in the ingame settings. 
Default controls are the following:

```
Tab to shoot rope
Hold b to wind rope
Hold left ctrl to unwind the rope
Left Alt to enter / exit gun mode while in rappel
E to detach rope
```
Ropes are manually synced but only when the client is near the origin of the rope. Retroactive syncing can easily be implemented by remembering the location of the rope server side and either using a grid based system or location checking for sync.

## TODO
Probably port it back to lua.

Fix visual bugs
